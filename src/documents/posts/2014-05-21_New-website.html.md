title: 'New website design!'

Today nAdoni has a new website with a familiar design. The changes to the website are mainly below the surface and less so in the design. 

The website is generated by [DocPad](http://docpad.org) and contains the contents of the [pages](https://github.com/pvandervelde/nAdoni/tree/pages) branch and the GitHub [wiki](https://github.com/pvandervelde/nAdoni/wiki) pages.

A build job has been set-up on the same build server that builds the nAdoni releases to update the website each time there is an update to either one of the involved repositories. 

If you find any problems with the site create a new [issue](https://github.com/pvandervelde/nAdoni/issues). And otherwise I hope you enjoy the updated website.
